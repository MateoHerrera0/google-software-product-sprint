<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Google SPS is an 11 week program where students (<- that's me :0) work alongside Googlers with the objective of furthering important technical skills and getting hands on career mentorship

In this program I'll have the opportunity to build my resume, practice my interviewing skills, network with Googlers across the company, and learn more about many of their technical career paths.
